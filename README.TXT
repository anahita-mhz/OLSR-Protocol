README FILE FOR "CS-6390 PROJECT"

Information Needed:
	
	** I used cs1.utdallas.edu for running my code.
	** As I wrote my code in java, it can be compiled using:
		
		> javac Controller.java
		> javac Node.java
		
		or using the makefile I made.
		
	** It can also be ran via:
		
		> java Controller
		> java Node <expected arguments>
		
		But, you just need to change the scenario.sh (scenario.bat in windows) file and run it.
